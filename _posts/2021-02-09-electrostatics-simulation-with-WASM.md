Old unfinished project which aimed to create a modern replacement to *Calculating Electromagnetic Fields and 
Potentials using Poisson's Equation* by Jarek Tuszynski. I wanted to allow the user to draw arbitrary electrodes at given voltages and simulate the electric potential and electric field. 

I finished the simulation, but never got arround to the drawing part, so it only has two scenarios.
